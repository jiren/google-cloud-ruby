      # # Instance
      #
      # Represents a Cloud Spanner instance. Instances are dedicated Cloud
      # Spanner serving and storage resources to be used by Cloud Spanner
      # databases. Instances offer isolation: problems with databases in one
      # instance will not affect other instances. However, within an instance
      # databases can affect each other. For example, if one database in an
      # instance receives a lot of requests and consumes most of the instance
      # resources, fewer resources are available for other databases in that
      # instance, and their performance may suffer.
      #
